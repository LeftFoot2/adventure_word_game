# Overview

This is a word adventure game. Will be able to choose from three classes they want to play as. (Right now the only class that has 
functionality is the warrior class.) The user will be able to do one of two things go on a quest, in which they will be match up with
a random monster, or go to the store for better gear. (Store right now auto levels player and there is not coin
in this version of the game.) You goal in the game is to beat the dragon StarFire.

I have written this in Kotlin to get me familiar with some of its basic features of the language, so although it is not yet complete
it has helped me do that.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
